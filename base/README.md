# codebase in C
codebase for programming in C

### Disclaimer
Idea for this codebase stems from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IAlJSIjvH0&ab_channel=VoxelRifts)and it's foundation is also based on the their [codebase](https://github.com/PixelRifts/c-codebase).

I've been reluctant to use it since not only the feauters it provides deemed unnecessary to me, but also because I wanted to take this as a opportunity of improving myself in my favourite language, C.
